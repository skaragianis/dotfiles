```

### Configure fish (using Oh My Fish)

```bash
fish
fish_add_path /opt/homebrew/bin
echo "/opt/homebrew/bin/fish" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/master/bin/install | fish
omf install bobthefish
```

And add the following to config.fish

```bash
pyenv init - | source

function n --wraps nnn --description 'support nnn quit and change directory'
    # Block nesting of nnn in subshells
    if test -n "$NNNLVL" -a "$NNNLVL" -ge 1
        echo "nnn is already running"
        return
    end

    # The behaviour is set to cd on quit (nnn checks if NNN_TMPFILE is set)
    # If NNN_TMPFILE is set to a custom path, it must be exported for nnn to
    # see. To cd on quit only on ^G, remove the "-x" from both lines below,
    # without changing the paths.
    if test -n "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"
        set -x NNN_TMPFILE "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nnn/.lastd"
    else
        set -x NNN_TMPFILE "$HOME/.config/nnn/.lastd"
    end

    # Unmask ^Q (, ^V etc.) (if required, see `stty -a`) to Quit nnn
    # stty start undef
    # stty stop undef
    # stty lwrap undef
    # stty lnext undef

    # The command function allows one to alias this function to `nnn` without
    # making an infinitely recursive alias
    command nnn $argv

    if test -e $NNN_TMPFILE
        source $NNN_TMPFILE
        rm -- $NNN_TMPFILE
    end
end
```
